# Master configuration file for the network driver.
# All settings described here are optional - if omitted, sensible
# defaults are used.

# firewall_backend:
#
#   determines which subsystem to use to setup firewall packet
#   filtering rules for virtual networks.
#
#   Supported settings:
#
#     iptables - use iptables commands to construct the firewall
#     nftables - use nft commands to construct the firewall
#
#   If firewall_backend isn't set in this file, libvirt will
#   prefer the @FIREWALL_BACKEND@ backend *if the necessary package.
#   binary is installed*, otherwise it will look for the package/binary
#   needed for the other backend and use that if available. If neither
#   is available on the host, then the network driver will fail to
#   start, and an error will be logged.
#
#   (NB: switching from one backend to another while there are active
#   virtual networks *is* supported. The change will take place the
#   next time that libvirtd/virtnetworkd is restarted - all existing
#   virtual networks will have their old firewalls removed, and then
#   reloaded using the new backend.)
